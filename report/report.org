* General reactivity of rank 1
  In temporal logic, general reactivity formulas of rank 1 are
  formulas in the shape

  \[(\square\diamondsuit f_1 \wedge \square\diamondsuit f_2 \wedge \dots \wedge
  \square\diamondsuit f_n) \rightarrow (\square\diamondsuit g_1 \wedge
  \square\diamondsuit g_2 \wedge \dots \wedge \square\diamondsuit g_n)\]

  In other words

  \[\bigwedge_{i=1}^n\square\diamondsuit f_i \rightarrow \bigwedge_{i=1}^n
  \square \diamondsuit g_i\]

  To prove that a given model respects such specifications we can see
  it in another way, and verify weather the model does /not/ satisfy

  \[(\bigwedge_{i=1}^n\square\diamondsuit f_i) \wedge
  (\bigvee_{i=1}^n\diamondsuit\square (\neg g_i))\]

  By seeing the problem this way we have a clearer way to implement an
  algorithm to find weather a given specification is satisfied or not,
  following the general scheme:
  - find the loops respecting \(\square\diamondsuit f_1\), from that, find
    the loops respecting \(\square\diamondsuit f_2\), and so on, until you
    either found a loop satisfying \(\bigwedge_{i=1}^n\square\diamondsuit
    f_i\) or an empty set.
    + If an empty set was found, the property is respected, the
      hypothesis is false.
    + if not, go to the next step
  - for each \(g_i\), starting from the loops respecting
    \(\bigwedge_{i=1}^n\square\diamondsuit f_i\) search for a loop
    respecting \(\diamondsuit\square g_i\)
    + if any of such loop is found, return a counterexample
    + if no such loop is found, the property is still respected
